Apple IR receiver Driver (appleir)
----------------------------------
	Copyright (C) 2009 Bastien Nocera <hadess@hadess.net>

The appleir driver is a kernel input driver to handle Apple's IR
receivers (and associated remotes) in the kernel.

The driver is an input driver which only handles "official" remotes
as built and sold by Apple.

button support and suspend support)

Supported hardware
------------------

- All Apple laptops and desktops from 2005 onwards, except:
  - the unibody Macbook (2009)
  - Mac Pro (all versions)
- Apple TV (all revisions prior to September 2010)

The remote will only support the 6 (old white) or 7 (brushed metal) buttons
of the remotes as sold by Apple. See the next section if you want to use
other remotes or want to use lirc with the device instead of the kernel driver.

Using lirc (native) instead of the kernel driver
------------------------------------------------

First, you will need to disable the kernel driver for the receiver.

This can be achieved by passing quirks to the usbhid driver.
The quirk line would be:
usbhid.quirks=0x05ac:0x8242:0x40000010

With 0x05ac being the vendor ID (Apple, you shouldn't need to change this)
With 0x8242 being the product ID (check the output of lsusb for your hardware)
And 0x10 being "HID_QUIRK_HIDDEV_FORCE" and 0x40000000 being "HID_QUIRK_NO_IGNORE"

This should force the creation of a hiddev device for the receiver, and
make it usable under lirc.
